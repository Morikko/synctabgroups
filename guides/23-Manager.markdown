### Wide Group List
 - Special page for reorganizing your groups
 - The group list with tab advantages:
   - it is wider
   - it isn't closed automatically
 - Behaviors are similar than in the menu except:
   - A click on a group expand/reduce its tabs (instead of switching/focusing)
   - A click on a tab does nothing (instead of opening/focusing it)

### Double list mode

 - You can reorganize your tabs without carrying about the relative position between groups
 - Drag & Drop is cross compatible between lists
 - Tip: use the <a href="#id-modal-search">search</a> to filter groups or tabs
